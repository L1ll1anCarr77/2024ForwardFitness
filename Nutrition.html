			     <h3>Food for Thought</h3>
				 <img src="images/food-thought.jpg" alt="food for thought image" class="round">
				 
			     <p>Good Nutrition is a lifestyle, not a diet. It starts with a new way of thinking about food. Think of your body as a vehicle that uses food for fuel. Fill your tank with the right type of fuel.</p>
			      
			     <p>Do not approach your nutrition plan as a diet plan, but rather, a lifestyle change. If you make permanent change, you will see big results. The key to success is a daily focus on your goal.</p>
			 
				 <p>Control impulsive urges to buy junk food, and instead, allow yourself to one "cheat" meal a week.</p>

			       <h3>What to Eat</h3>
				   <img src="images/fresh-food.jpg" alt="fresh vegtables, fruit, eggs, and nuts" class="round">
				 
				   <p>Use the following as a guideline:</p>
				 
				   <ul>
				       <li>Protein, such as eggs, chicken, and lean red meat</li>
				       <li>Fruit</li>
				       <li>Fat, such as olive oil, nuts,and seeds</li>
				   </ul>
				   <p>Limit the consumption of bread, pasta, white potatoes, and processed foods. These foods are high in carbohydrates.</p>
				 
				   <p>When you shop for groceries, shop the outside aisles and but organic when possible. Stock up on fresh vegtables, almond flour, and flax seed.</p>

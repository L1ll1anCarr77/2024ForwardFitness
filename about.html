			      <dl>
                     <dt>Burpee</dt>
					  <dd>Burpees are a great, full body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position.</dd>
					  
					  <dt>Plank</dt>
					  <dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push up position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you can.</dd>
					  
					  <dt>Mountain climber</dt>
					  <dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a push up position, then bring one knee upto your chest and then switch as quickly as you can(as though you are climbing a mountain). </dd>
